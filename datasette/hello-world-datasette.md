# Hello, world with Datasette


## Prerequisites

I have a SQLite databse in `tils.db`. 

I have `datasette` available on my `$PATH`. 

## ðŸš€ Get going


With that ready and `tils.db` in `$PWD`, do:

```
datasette serve ./tils.db
```


Browse to [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) and get started issuing queries at the Web interface.


You can browse the DB. There are a lot of nice helpers built in to describe the data for you.
