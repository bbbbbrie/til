# Insert emoji on macOS -- without a mouse or extra software

I was very excited to learn that macOS supports adding emoji without the use of a mouse or a third-party app. It's awkward but it works:

  - `Cmd` + `Ctrl` + `Space` to bring up the emoji chooser
  - Type to search for the emoji
  - Use the arrow keys to navigate through the emoji
  - Press `Enter` to insert the emoji

  - Matthew Palmer's [Rocket app](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) also permits very easy emoji insertion. Users of `vim` are warned. The app relies on quite a bit of usage of the `:` character. It looks like it's possible to modify this behavior by changing the [trigger keys](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/help.html#trigger-keys). 
  - You may need to make [some changes](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/1927) to get [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) to play nicely with Rocket.
