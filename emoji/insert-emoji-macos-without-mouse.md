# Insert emoji on macOS -- without a mouse

I was very excited to learn that macOS supports adding emoji without the use of a mouse or a third-party app. It's awkward but it works:

  - `Cmd` + `Ctrl` + `Space` to bring up the emoji chooser
  - Type to search for the emoji
  - Use the arrow keys to navigate through the emoji
  - Press `Enter` to insert the emoji
