# Observe query complexity with GitLab's GraphQL API

We can use [the `queryComplexity` query](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#queryquerycomplexity) to get some information about the complexity of the query that is being executed. You would add this to your query to include the informaiton about the complexity:

```
queryComplexity {
    limit
    score
  }
```

The `queryComplexity` query does not require authentication and is not free.  

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://gitlab.example.com/api/graphql \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer glpat-' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"query": "query { queryComplexity {   limit    } }"}'
```
