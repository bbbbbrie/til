# TIL about Cloudflare Radar

The [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/) dashboard has some interesting data about traffic volume, activity, trends and comparisons. It's a really interesting site with [an API available](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/). For traffic seen by Cloudflare, they show cool things like:

  - traffic by device type (moble vs desktop)
  - HTTP version usage (HTTP/1.x vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3)
  - an [Internet outage map](https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center) 
    - The data here is a real snapshot of current events this year: the most recent outage is a government directed outage in the Kurdistan province in Iran. The other two outages in 2022 are in Ukraine due to power outages and military action. 
  - IPv6 usage continues to be [big in India](https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage/in).
